In order for this project to run, we use 2 repositories: 
- Datathon2023 (UI) https://github.com/jordibernandi/Datathon2023 
- Datathon2023_Flask (Micro-service sentence embedding) https://github.com/jordibernandi/Datathon2023_Flask

For the UI, we already deployed it online using Netlify through this link: https://fancy-haupia-6a87c2.netlify.app
For the micro service, u need to run it in localhost by running python app.py
